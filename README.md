A final project for CS222. This project will take audio content from spotify and let the user find any audio content they want and input them on a page.
## Getting Started

Our program should solve the following: 1. Search content on spotify. 2. Find specific audio content such as music, audiobooks, and podcasts. 3. Find similar content to my interests so that
I can find more audio content to listen to. 4. Find audio content much quicker so that users can start their workout sooner.

The reason we are making this program is so that gym rats are able to find all types of content on spotify in order to get to their workouts quicker and easier.
